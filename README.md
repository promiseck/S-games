🎯 Python Mini Games Collection

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly yet fun projects developed using the Python programming language.
These projects are great for learning programming fundamentals, practicing problem-solving, and exploring Python’s capabilities.

📌 Projects Included
1️⃣ Guessing App

A simple number guessing game where:

The program randomly selects a number within a defined range.

The player has to guess the number in the fewest attempts possible.

Hints are given to indicate whether the guess is too high or too low.

🔑 Concepts Covered:

Random number generation (random module)

Loops and conditional statements

User input handling

2️⃣ Hangman

A text-based version of the classic Hangman game:

The program selects a random word from a predefined list.

The player guesses letters one by one.

Incorrect guesses reduce the number of remaining attempts.

The game ends when the player guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

🔑 Concepts Covered:

String manipulation

Lists and loops

Conditional logic

3️⃣ Tic Tac Toe

A two-player console-based game where:

Players take turns marking spaces on a 3×3 grid.

The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.

The game declares a draw if all spaces are filled with no winner.

🔑 Concepts Covered:

Lists and nested lists for board representation

Functions for cleaner code structure

Win-condition checking logic

Input validation

4️⃣ Rock, Paper, Scissors

The classic hand game implemented in Python:

The player chooses rock, paper, or scissors.

The computer randomly selects its choice.

The winner is determined based on game rules.
